An Xplenty **job** is a process that is responsible for performing a data flow according to a specific package on a cluster. The job is a batch process that runs on a finite amount of data and then terminates. Several jobs can run the same package simultaneously.
When you call the Xplenty API to run a new job, you supply the name of the package whose workflow the job should perform, and the cluster on which to run.
