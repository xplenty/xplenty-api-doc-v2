## Create Cluster

### Description
Create a new [cluster](https://github.com/xplenty/xplenty-api-doc-v2/blob/master/resources/cluster.md).

### Notes
* This call only triggers cluster creation, and therefore it returns the "pending" status. You can run a job on a pending cluster, but if for any reason the cluster failed to initialize, the job will fail to run.
You can verify that a cluster has initialized successfully by [retrieving the cluster's information](https://github.com/xplenty/xplenty-api-doc-v2/blob/master/sections/get-cluster-information.md) and checking for the "available" status.
* You must save the cluster ID value returned in the response "id" field. You will use the value to refer to this cluster in subsequent API calls.

### Input Parameters
|Name|Required?|    Default|Description|
|----|---------|    -------|-----------|
|nodes|Y| |Determines the number of compute nodes in the cluster. The value range is between 2 and your account's maximum, determined by the chosen pricing plan|
type|N|production|If the value is set to "sandbox", a sandbox cluster is created and the "nodes" parameter is ignored
name|N|System generated|Name to assign to the new cluster
description|N|Blank|Description to assign to the new cluster
terminate_on_idle|N|false|If the value is set to either true, t or 1 this cluster will be terminated after it becomes idle
time_to_idle|N|3600 seconds (60 minutes)|The time interval (in seconds) after which this cluster will become idle
region|N|Account region setting|The region in which the cluster should be created|
zone|N||The zone in which the cluster should be created (for availability zone supported regions)|
master_instance_type|N||The type of the master instance|
slave_instance_type|N||The type of the slave instance|
master_spot_price|N||The maximum bid price (in USD) requested for master spot instance|
slave_spot_price|N||The maximum bid price (in USD) requested for slave spot instance|
master_spot_percentage|N||The percentage of master instances requested as spot (value between 0 and 1)|
slave_spot_percentage|N||The percentage of slave instances requested as spot (value between 0 and 1)|
allow_fallback|N||If the value is set to either true, t or 1 instances will be created as on-demand instances if spot requests are not fulfilled|
stack|N|"white-everest"|The stack of the cluster|
bootstrap_actions|N| |The array of the custom bootstrap actions|
