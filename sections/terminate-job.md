## Terminate Job
 
### Description
Stop an active [job](https://github.com/xplenty/xplenty-api-doc-v2/blob/master/resources/job.md). Usually it's not necessary to request to terminate a job, because the job will end when its tasks are completed. You may want to actively terminate a job if you need its cluster resources for a more urgent job, or if the job is taking too long to complete.

### Notes
* This call only triggers the job's termination, which is why a status of "pending_stoppage" is returned. To verify stoppage, [get the job's information](https://github.com/xplenty/xplenty-api-doc-v2/blob/master/sections/get-job-information.md) and check for a status of "stopped".
* If a job is stopped by the user, it may return only partial results or none at all, depending on its tasks and its stage at the time of stoppage.

### Input Parameters
The **job ID** must be supplied at the end of the request URL.

### Request (Curl Call) Syntax
```shell
$ curl -X DELETE -u api_key: "https://api.xplenty.com/:account_id/api/jobs/:job_id" \
